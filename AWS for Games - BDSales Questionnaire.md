# 🔨 BUILD: Game Development & Content Creation

> <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Phase-BUILD-orange?style=flat-square"> *The BUILD phase encompasses all activities related to creating game content, assets, and code. This includes development infrastructure, content creation pipelines, and AI-assisted development tools.*

## 1. 🏗️ Development Infrastructure & Build Systems

### 💡 **Knowledge Context for Sales Rep**
> **🎓 Background**: Game development requires robust build systems that handle complex codebases, large binary assets, and multiple target platforms. Unlike traditional software, games often have lengthy build times due to asset processing, shader compilation, and platform-specific optimizations. A typical AAA game build can take 2-8 hours, and studios often need to build for 5+ platforms simultaneously. This creates significant infrastructure costs and developer productivity challenges.

### 🔍 **Primary Discovery Questions**

<details>
<summary><strong>💬 "Walk me through your current development workflow from code commit to playable build."</strong></summary>

**🎯 Listen for**: Build triggers, automation level, manual steps, bottlenecks, team size impact

**🔄 Natural Follow-ups based on their response**:

- **If they mention manual builds**: 
  > ❓ "How much developer time is spent managing builds versus writing code? What happens when builds fail during critical milestones?"

- **If they mention long build times**: 
  > ⏱️ "What's your typical build time for a full build versus incremental? How does this impact your team's productivity, especially during crunch periods?"

- **If they mention multiple platforms**: 
  > 🎮 "Which platforms are you targeting, and do you build them sequentially or in parallel? How do you handle platform-specific optimizations and requirements?"

- **If they mention build queues**: 
  > 💰 "During peak development hours, how long do developers wait for builds? Have you considered the cost of developer time versus infrastructure investment?"

# 🚀 RUN: Game Backend & Operations

> <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Phase-RUN-blue?style=flat-square"> *The RUN phase covers all aspects of deploying, operating, and maintaining live game services. This includes backend infrastructure, databases, real-time services, monitoring, and player-facing systems.*

## 1. 🏗️ Game Backend Architecture & Deployment

### 💡 **Knowledge Context for Sales Rep**
> **🎓 Background**: Modern game backends are complex distributed systems handling millions of concurrent players, real-time interactions, and massive data volumes. A successful mobile game might handle 100,000+ concurrent users with sub-100ms response times. Architecture choices significantly impact scalability, cost, and player experience. Studios are moving from monolithic architectures to microservices, adopting containerization, and implementing sophisticated CI/CD pipelines. The challenge is balancing complexity with reliability while controlling costs.

## 2. 🗄️ Databases & Data Management

### 💡 **Knowledge Context for Sales Rep**
> **🎓 Background**: Game databases must handle diverse data types and access patterns: player profiles (read-heavy), real-time game state (low-latency), leaderboards (complex queries), and analytics data (write-heavy). A typical mobile game might store 50+ data points per player, handle 10,000+ transactions per second, and maintain leaderboards for millions of players. Different database technologies excel at different use cases - relational for complex transactions, NoSQL for scale and flexibility, in-memory for real-time data. Modern game architectures use polyglot persistence.

## 3. 🎮 Dedicated Game Servers & Matchmaking

### 💡 **Knowledge Context for Sales Rep**
> **🎓 Background**: Multiplayer games require dedicated servers for authoritative gameplay, anti-cheat protection, and consistent player experience. A successful multiplayer game might need 1,000+ concurrent game sessions across multiple regions, with each session requiring 1-4 CPU cores and specific network latency requirements.
